1. The asyncWrapper middleware was created to handlle errors in async.route handlers. We don't need to repeat use try{}catch{} and it makes code more readably.

2.Answer:
const getTask = asyncWrapper(async (req, res, next) => {  
  const { id: taskID } = req.params;  
  const task = await Task.findOne({ _id: taskID });  
  if (!task) {  
    // your code here
     return next(createCustomError(`No task with ID: ${taskID}`, 404)) 
  }  
  res.status(200).json({ task });  
});
